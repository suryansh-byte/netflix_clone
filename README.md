# Netflix Clone

This repository is a simple static website project — a Netflix-style landing/cloning exercise built with HTML and CSS.

## What this is

- A static front-end clone of a Netflix-like interface (layout, hero, basic navigation and styles).
- Intended as a learning / portfolio project. No backend or authentication is included.

## Files

- `index.html` — Main landing page
- `browse.html` — Browse or content listing (placeholder)
- `signin.html` — Sign-in form page (static)
- `faq.html` — Frequently asked questions page
- `style.css` — Global stylesheet

## How to run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with).

Alternatively, serve the folder with a static server for nicer behavior (recommended if you use modules or fetch):

```
# using Python 3 in the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes

- This is a purely static project. All links and forms are placeholders unless you add backend logic.
- Feel free to add more assets (images, scripts) and update the README with credits and license.

## License

This project is provided as-is for learning. Add a license file if you want to specify reuse terms (e.g., `LICENSE` with MIT).
